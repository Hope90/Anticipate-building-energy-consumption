# Anticipate-building-energy-consumption
## Context of this project:
You work for the city of Seattle. To achieve its goal of a carbon-neutral city in 2050, your team is closely interested in the consumption and emissions of buildings not intended for residential.

Careful surveys were carried out by city officials in 2016.

Here is the data source: https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy.

However, these data are expensive to obtain, and from those already carried out, you want to try to predict the CO2 emissions and the total energy consumption of buildings not intended for housing for which they have not yet been measured.

Your prediction will be based on the structural data of the buildings (size and use of the buildings, date of construction, geographical location, etc.)

You are also looking to evaluate the interest of the "ENERGY STAR Score" (https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/benchmark/analyze_benchmarking_results) for the prediction of emissions, which is tedious to calculate with the approach currently used by your team. You will integrate it into the modeling and judge its interest.

Here is a summary of your mission:

Carry out a short exploratory analysis.

Test different prediction models in order to best respond to the problem.
